# Difculties included
# the orginal setup of having tmodloader installed correctly alongside visual studio community 2019
# Adding a on hit effect on the sword for burn damage was not able to do 
# at first was not able to create my own texture for the sword had to go through another program to which is till did not work until 
#eventualy finding out the name of the png file had to be the same as in the code. Worked out in the end though


# Enjoyment / Learned
# Overall enjoyed using community 2019 as it is much more expansive the normal studio code
# enjoyed the creating my out texture pack for my own sword along with changing the damgage level. 
# Tmodloader was extremely user friendly with setting a majority of the files for you 
# Got some knowledge into the C sharp language
